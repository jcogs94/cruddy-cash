## Overview
This app will allow you to keep track of all your finances in a quick and easy way.

## Getting Started:
You can find the link to the app [here](http://18.224.41.247:3000/) and see the process that I took [here](https://trello.com/b/X7KRsf6z).

## Technologies Used:
- Mongoose
- Express
- Node.js
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

## Next Steps:
- Make the site more desktop-friendly. As of right now, the site is useable on desktop devices, but clearly is just a wider version of the mobile.
- A hamburger menu is currently used to display the links to make a budget and view budgets, but the desktop version should have the links displayed separately and inline.
- The app could use a change in color palette. The black/white/gray scheme seems bland.
- Email varification would be good to ensure fake emails are not being used.
- Reviewing the model structure to ensure efficiency.
- Reworking the CSS structure to simplify the layout of the files.
- More interactive elements to make adding/editing/removing groups and entries more intuitive (perhaps with the use of iframes).
